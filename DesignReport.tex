\section{Security Objective}

Our goal is to prevent a process overload attack when using our shell. A 
process overload attack occurs when a process forks more processes than the
underlying operating system can handle. If the operating system is not prepared
to handle this kind of attack, it may cause the kernel to crash. This can 
occur either maliciously or unintentionally\footnote{This actually occurred
during our implementation of lab1c, in which we accidentally created an 
infinite loop while forking our parallel processes. It took another half hour
to regain control long enough to kill all of the rogue processes}, but in 
either case, we must be prepared to mitigate or kill the processes before it 
gets out of control. \\ 

Our implementation will seek to control the flow of the attack and ultimately
kill the processes before they cause our kernel to crash. \\

In summary:
\begin{description}
\item[Primary Objective] \hfill \\
To kill rogue processes from forking uncontrollably.
\item[Secondary Objective] \hfill \\
To ensure fairness in other running processes by reducing the priority of these
rogue processes.

\section{Design Overview}

To start, we define a maximum number of processes that our shell (which is 
itself a process) can fork at any given time. This will be our \textbf{hard  
limit}; upon reaching this limit, we will kill the shell and any processes that
were forked from it to begin with. By checking the group process ID (GPID) of 
our shell function, we will be able to count how many other processes have the 
same GPID. We can also verify this through \textbf{pstree}, which creates a
tree of processes that we can refer to when forking. \\
We will also attempt to ensure fairness towards other running processes in the
system by lowering the priority of our shell if it starts to generate a large
number of forked processes. This will be our \textbf{soft limit}, as we will
attempt to slow the forking process first when we reach this limit, rather 
than kill it outright. We assume that when a process hits this limit, it is
possible that it is not a malicious program, and that it just needs more forked
processes than the norm. Therefore, we slow down the forking process to allow 
more time for its previously forked processes to catch up and finish. In the
event that it is indeed a malicious program (or a process that unintentionally 
created an infinite forking loop), then we should take appropriate action when 
we reach the hard limit and kill the process. \\

% Because of this reaction, the required ratio is the atomic weight of magnesium: \SI{16.00}{g} of oxygen as experimental mass of Mg: experimental mass of oxygen or $\frac{x}{1.31}=\frac{16}{0.87}$ from which, $M_{\ce{Mg}} = 16.00 \times \frac{1.31}{0.87} = 24.1 = \SI{24}{g/mol}$ (to two significant figures).

\section{Implementation}
In this section, we will discuss the details of our design implementation. We
have broken it down into the following modules:
\subsection{Polling the children}
To make our design work, we needed to change our current \verb+execute_command+
implementation. In our original implementation of lab 1b, we used 
\verb+waitpid+ to block our parent process, only returning once the child had
finished running. While perfectly adequate for the lab, we realized that in 
order for us to continuously update the number of newly spawned processes, we
would need to modify our design to poll the child process instead. So, instead 
of blocking in the parent process, waiting for the child to finish, we instead 
introduce a \verb+WNOHANG+ flag to \verb+waitpid+, which indicates that we 
will continue to poll the child periodically to check on its status instead of
``hanging'' the parent process until the child returns. \\

\subsection{Watchdog Function}
We created a watchdog function that would run in the parent process. Its duties
involved keeping track of the total number of processes and modifying the 
relative priority of these processes when certain soft limits were exceeded. 
This process was called in our \verb+execute-command+ function, and was
repeatedly run every time \verb+waitpid+ indicated that the child process had
not yet exited. \\
The following describe the different tasks that our watchdog accomplished:
\subsubsection{Counting processes}
In this first part of our approach, we want to monitor the total number of
processes on our shell. To accomplish this, we scanned the \verb+\proc+ folder
in the root directory of our Linux system. This folder houses information on
all running processes, organized by naming each directory after its PID. By 
using \verb+getpgrp()+ to identify the \textbf{process group ID} (PGID) of our 
shell, we then scanned through each of the process's \verb+\stat+ file, which 
housed a wealth of information. We compared each process's PGID and only 
proceeded if its PGID matched our shell's PGID, as this was where the initial
running processes were forked from. \\
From there, we would increment a counter every time we encountered a process 
with the same PGID as the shell. We would only update the final total if the
final PID encountered during that pass was greater than the final PID 
encountered during the last pass. This design choice was based on the simple
assumption that a forked process will have a higher PID than its parent -
therefore, if we do not encounter any processes with the same PGID but higher
PID, then we do not need to update the total number of processes, as there were
no new processes forked in between the two polling events.

\subsubsection{Playing nice}
As mentioned in the design overview, we also included soft limits in our design
to slow down legitimate processes that may simply require several forked 
processes. We ultimately decided to use three levels of soft limits, each 
divided into equal quarters of the hard limit. When the total number of forked
processes exceeded any of these limits, our watchdog program would adjust the 
nice levels accordingly, decreasing the priority of all forked processes until
the hard limit was reached. In addition, we would also print out a warning 
message every time this occurred, letting the user know that the priority of 
the shell processes was being lowered because they were utilizing too many
resources.

\subsubsection{Hitting the kill switch}
Once the hard limit was reached, we would print out a final message, letting 
the user know that he had reached the maxmium allowable number of processes.
We then ran a \verb+killpg+ command on all processes with the same process
group ID as the running process. This would also kill the shell, meaning no
further commands would be run from the script. \\

\subsection{Testing Environment}
Though at first, we ran our program on the UCLA CS Lion server, we realized
that it had the potential to affect other users who were running their own jobs
on the server. To that end, we changed out environment to the CS111 virtual 
machine distribution - if our shell or even our kernel crashed in the VM, it 
would be a trivial matter to reboot our system and try again. Modifying our 
test case such that it would not fork in an infinite loop was another viable
solution, to prevent our kernel from crashing in the first place. \\

%	SECTION 6
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Penetration Testing}

In this section, we will discuss the tests that we ran. This section will
include the step-by-step instructions on how to run our demo against both good
and malicious inputs.

\subsection{Running the demo}
To run our demo, we have included two extra files in our tarball. One is the
test script, \verb+testDesign.sh+, which consists of two commands. The first
command runs our malicious binary, and the second command is there just to
confirm that our shell has really killed itself and all of the other running
processes forked from the shell. \\
The second file is the source code of our malicious input, \verb+testFork.c+.


\subsection{Designing the malicious input}
Our malicious input consists of the following:

\begin{lstlisting}
#include <getopt.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
	// int i = 0;
	while(1) {
		fork();
		// i++;
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}
The sections that are commented out can be uncommented, along with modifying 
the while loop such that we fork a specified number of times, rather than
forking in an infinite loop. This became important later on, as we were testing
the robustness of our script to handle processes that forked a specified 
number of times.

\subsection{Time Testing}
As we were also modifying the priority of 

% The accepted value (periodic table) is \SI{24.3}{g/mol} \cite{Smith:2012qr}. The percentage discrepancy between the accepted value and the result obtained here is 1.3\%. Because only a single measurement was made, it is not possible to calculate an estimated standard deviation. \\

% The most obvious source of experimental uncertainty is the limited precision of the balance. Other potential sources of experimental uncertainty are: the reaction might not be complete; if not enough time was allowed for total oxidation, less than complete oxidation of the magnesium might have, in part, reacted with nitrogen in the air (incorrect reaction); the magnesium oxide might have absorbed water from the air, and thus weigh ``too much." Because the result obtained is close to the accepted value it is possible that some of these experimental uncertainties have fortuitously cancelled one another.

\section{Robustness Analysis}

In this section, we will analyze how effective our implementation was at
detecting and killing process overload attacks, while still allowing other 
processes to go about their merry way. We will also discuss the tradeoffs of
going from a blocking method to polling the children in our implementation. \\


Changing our implementation from blocking to polling had no noticeable effect
on our runtime. However, if we had a long running child (such as a process that
hits an infinite loop), it is possible that this could affect our run-time 
performance. Namely, when a process is \textbf{blocked}, it indicates to the 
kernel  \\


First, by limiting the maximum number of processes on the shell, we can prevent our shell from being overloaded since it will stop forking when it already has a certain number of processes.
Second, by increasing the nice factor when a process trying to fork too many child processes, we can let it fork slower.  Hence, it won’t occupy the shared resources on the shell, which may let other users cannot use the resources. \\

\section{Results}

In this section, we will discuss our results, document the known bugs in our 
code, and close with the challenges that we encountered along the way. \\ 

\subsection{Division of Work}
Spencer implemented the process counting and killing, while Li implemented the
process priority setting. \\

\subsection{Known Bugs}
When we run our infinite loop fork test, our shell very quickly detects and
shuts down our shell. However, if we were to manually set the number of forked 
processes per process, our shell begins to exhibit undefined behavior between 
$i = 5$ and $i = 15$ forks per process. Anything less than 5 will complete
before our watchdog detects it, and anything more than 15 will be detected by
our watchdog and dealt with accordingly. But when we fork $5 - 15$ times per
process, the shell begins to complain that it is unable to open the file, and
seems to crash on its own volition. Other times, it would crash the first 
command, yet still run the rest of the commands in our shell script. We were 
unable to determine the cause of this bug.\\
In addition, possibly owing to the fact that our hard limit is set to only
$100$ processes, there is no significant deviation from a runtime of abou
$20ms$, regardless of how many forked processes we introduce. \\

\subsection{Challenges}
We encountered a number of challenges along the way. Outside of the usual 
debugging process, here were the main challenges that beset our progress:
\subsubsection{Method to count the processes}
\subsubsection{Polling the child's forked processes}
In our original implementation of lab 1b, we would used \verb+waitpid+ to block
the parent process, and only return when after the child had completed. 
\subsubsection{Updating the nice level for all forked processes}
