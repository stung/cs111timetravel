\section{Security Objective}

Our goal is to prevent a process overload attack when using our shell. A 
process overload attack occurs when a process forks more processes than the
underlying operating system can handle. If the operating system is not prepared
to handle this kind of attack, it may cause the kernel to crash. This can 
occur either maliciously or unintentionally\footnote{This actually occurred
during our implementation of lab1c, in which we accidentally created an 
infinite loop while forking our parallel processes. It took another half hour
to regain control long enough to kill all of the rogue processes}, but in 
either case, we must be prepared to mitigate or kill the processes before it 
gets out of control. \\ 

Our implementation will seek to control the flow of the attack and ultimately
kill the processes before they cause our kernel to crash.

% \begin{description}
% \item[Stoichiometry]
% The relationship between the relative quantities of substances taking part in a reaction or forming a compound, typically a ratio of whole integers.
% \item[Atomic mass]
% The mass of an atom of a chemical element expressed in atomic mass units. It is approximately equivalent to the number of protons and neutrons in the atom (the mass number) or to the average number allowing for the relative abundances of different isotopes.

\section{Design Overview}

To start, we define a maximum number of processes that our shell (which is 
itself a process) can fork at any given time. This will be our hard upper 
limit; upon reaching this limit, we will kill the shell and any processes that
were forked from it to begin with. \\


First, we aim to limit the maximum number of processes that our shell can fork at any given time.  If a process hits the limit, we will kill it if it continues to attempt to fork.
Second, we want to ensure fairness in other programs by checking the number of children that a parent has forked using pstree.  When the number of processes exceed a certain limit, we will start increasing its nice factor to slowdown its forking.

\section{The Security Principles of Saltzer and Schroeder}

% \begin{tabular}{ll}
% Mass of magnesium metal & = \SI{8.59}{g} - \SI{7.28}{g}\\
% & = \SI{1.31}{g}\\
% Mass of magnesium oxide & = \SI{9.46}{g} - \SI{7.28}{g}\\
% & = \SI{2.18}{g}\\
% Mass of oxygen & = \SI{2.18}{g} - \SI{1.31}{}\\
% & = \SI{0.87}{g}
% \end{tabular}\\
% Because of this reaction, the required ratio is the atomic weight of magnesium: \SI{16.00}{g} of oxygen as experimental mass of Mg: experimental mass of oxygen or $\frac{x}{1.31}=\frac{16}{0.87}$ from which, $M_{\ce{Mg}} = 16.00 \times \frac{1.31}{0.87} = 24.1 = \SI{24}{g/mol}$ (to two significant figures).

\section{Threat Model}

% The atomic weight of magnesium is concluded to be \SI{24}{g/mol}, as determined by the stoichiometry of its chemical combination with oxygen. This result is in agreement with the accepted value.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Penetration Testing}

% The accepted value (periodic table) is \SI{24.3}{g/mol} \cite{Smith:2012qr}. The percentage discrepancy between the accepted value and the result obtained here is 1.3\%. Because only a single measurement was made, it is not possible to calculate an estimated standard deviation. \\

% The most obvious source of experimental uncertainty is the limited precision of the balance. Other potential sources of experimental uncertainty are: the reaction might not be complete; if not enough time was allowed for total oxidation, less than complete oxidation of the magnesium might have, in part, reacted with nitrogen in the air (incorrect reaction); the magnesium oxide might have absorbed water from the air, and thus weigh ``too much." Because the result obtained is close to the accepted value it is possible that some of these experimental uncertainties have fortuitously cancelled one another.

\section{Robustness Analysis}

% \begin{enumerate}
% \begin{item}
% The \emph{atomic weight of an element} is the relative weight of one of its atoms compared to C-12 with a weight of 12.0000000$\ldots$, hydrogen with a weight of 1.008, to oxygen with a weight of 16.00. Atomic weight is also the average weight of all the atoms of that element as they occur in nature.
% \end{item}
% \begin{item}
% The \emph{units of atomic weight} are two-fold, with an identical numerical value. They are g/mole of atoms (or just g/mol) or amu/atom.
% \end{item}
% \begin{item}
% \emph{Percentage discrepancy} between an accepted (literature) value and an experimental value is $\frac{|\mathrm{experimental result} - \mathrm{accepted result}|}{\mathrm{accepted result}}$.
% \end{item}
% \end{enumerate}
